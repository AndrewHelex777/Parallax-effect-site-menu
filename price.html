            <h6><i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</i></h6>
            <p>EA Madden NFL (known as John Madden Football until 1993) is an American football sports video game series
                developed by EA Orlando for EA Sports. The franchise, named after Pro Football Hall of Fame coach and
                commentator John Madden, has sold over 150 million copies as of 2021.[1] From 2004 until 2022, it was
                the only officially licensed National Football League (NFL) video game series, and has influenced many
                players and coaches of the physical sport. Among the series' features are detailed playbooks and player
                statistics and voice commentary in the style of a real NFL television broadcast. As of 2013 the
                franchise has generated over $4 billion in sales, making it one of the most profitable video game
                franchises on the market.</p>
            <p>Electronic Arts (EA) founder Trip Hawkins conceived the series and approached Madden in 1984 for his
                endorsement and expertise. Because of Madden's insistence that the game be as realistic as possible, the
                first version of John Madden Football did not appear until 1988. EA has released annual versions since
                1990 with the number used in each release generally representing the year after the game's release date;
                for example, Madden NFL 2005 was released in 2004, ahead of the 2004 NFL season.</p>
            <h3 id="history">History</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4 id="1980s">1980s – Creation</h4>
            <p>Trip Hawkins created a clone of the Strat-O-Matic paper and dice-based football simulation game as a
                teenager. The game was unsuccessful due to its complexity, and he hoped to one day delegate its rules to
                a computer. At Harvard College, where Hawkins played football for the Crimson, he wrote a football
                simulation for the PDP-11 minicomputer which, he later said, predicted that the Miami Dolphins would
                defeat the Minnesota Vikings 23–6 (actually 24–7) in the 1974 Super Bowl.[3][4] After founding
                Electronic Arts in 1982[3]—"The real reason that I founded [it] was because I wanted to make
                computerized versions of games like Strat-O-Matic", Hawkins later said[2][5]—the company began designing
                a microcomputer football game. Hawkins first approached his favorite player Joe Montana to endorse the
                proposed game but the quarterback already had an endorsement deal with Atari, Inc., and his second
                choice, Cal coach Joe Kapp, demanded up-front royalties far in excess of what Hawkins was willing to
                pay.[3]</p>
            <p>In 1984, Hawkins approached former NFL coach and then-announcer John Madden. Hawkins and game producer
                Joe Ybarra arranged a follow-up meeting with Madden during an Amtrak train trip over two days because of
                Madden's fear of flying.[3][6][7][8] The EA executives promised that the proposed game would be a
                sophisticated football simulation and they asked the retired Oakland Raiders coach for his endorsement
                and expertise. Madden knew nothing about computers beyond his telestrator but agreed; he had taught a
                class at the University of California, Berkeley, called "Football for Fans", and envisioned the program
                as a tool for teaching and testing plays.[3][9][10] (Madden would continue to see the game as an
                educational tool. When asked in 2012 to describe Madden NFL, he called it "a way for people to learn the
                game and participate in the game at a pretty sophisticated level".[8]) Hawkins and Ybarra during the
                train trip learned football plays and strategies from Madden from sunrise to midnight.[3]</p>
            <p>EA likely expected Madden to endorse the game without participating in its design. Early plans envisioned
                six or seven players per team because of technical limitations but Madden insisted on having 11
                players,[3][8] stating "I'm not putting my name on it if it's not real".[7][10] Ybarra, who had played
                chess, not football, in high school, became an expert on the subject through his work, but found that 11
                players overwhelmed contemporary home computers. Most projects that are as delayed as Madden are
                canceled; Ybarra and developer Robin Antonick needed three years, more than twice the length of the
                average development process. The project became known within the company as "Trip's Folly", and
                Madden—who had received $100,000 advance against royalties that EA's outside auditors advised to
                write-off because it would never be recouped—believed at times that EA had given up.[3][10]</p>
            <p>The company hired Bethesda Softworks to finish the game, but this only got them partway to their goal.
                While EA used many of its designs, including contributions to their physics engine,[11] within a year
                Bethesda stopped working on Madden and sued EA over EA's failure to publish new versions of Bethesda's
                Gridiron! football game. This added to the delay.[7] After a final development push, John Madden
                Football debuted in 1988 for the Apple II computers. Hawkins and an exhausted Ybarra ("All my memories
                are of pain") could move on to other projects.[3]</p>
            <p>Contracted to provide plays,[10] Madden gave EA the 1980 Raiders playbook, and EA hired San Francisco
                Examiner writer Frank Cooney, who had designed his own figurine football game with numerical skill
                ratings. Those skill ratings, also utilized in a spreadsheet based game called Grid Grade, were a
                precursor to player ratings in Madden Football. Although the company could not yet legally use NFL
                teams' or players' names, Cooney obtained real plays from NFL teams.[3] The back of the box called the
                game "The First Real Football Simulation" and quoted Madden: "Hey, if there aren't 11 players, it isn't
                real football." Documentation included diagrams of dozens of offensive and defensive plays with Madden's
                commentary on coaching strategies and philosophy.[12] In addition to submitting plays, Cooney worked
                with programmers and producers to create numerical ratings for every player so they would perform
                appropriately in the game, especially in man-to-man situations. In the beginning there were eight to 12
                traits that were graded for each player. That number would grow to more than 200 as the game became more
                sophisticated. The game sold moderately well[3] but given the sophisticated playbook its interface was
                complex, and Madden's insistence on 11 players caused the game to run slowly.[7]</p>
            <p>During this period, Madden turned down the opportunity to buy an "unlimited" number of options for EA
                stock in its initial public offering, a decision he later called "the dumbest thing I ever did in my
                life".[3][8]</p>

            <p>
                Madden NFL 11 was released on July 27, 2010 (moved up from its original release date of August 10, 2010
                for
                promotional reasons[33]), and features New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees on the cover. It
                features
                several new additions to the franchise, such as Online Team Play,[34] Online Scouting[35] and online
                attribute boosts for co-op play.[36] Along with these new game additions is a new rating (sponsored by
                Old
                Spice) known as Swagger.[37] Although early speculation was that this new rating would be reflective of
                "confidence" or "composure," it was quickly confirmed to be directly tied to a player's personality for
                celebrations.[38]

                Madden NFL 12 was released on August 25, 2011. The release was delayed by two weeks due to the NFL
                lockout,[39] and features Cleveland Browns running back Peyton Hillis on the cover. However, there is a
                limited edition in which the cover features St. Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk.

                Madden NFL 13 was released on August 28, 2012, and features Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson
                as
                the cover athlete. Madden NFL 13 is the first Madden game to be released on the PlayStation Vita, and it
                is
                also the first game in the series to have Kinect support as well as a new physics engine promoting real
                in
                game physics.[40]
            </p>

            <p>
                Madden NFL 13 included a complete revamp to online franchise mode which became known as Connected
                Careers
                Mode (CCM). Some of the new CCM features included player contracts, the ability to trade draft picks, a
                salary cap, and up to 30 seasons worth of gameplay.[41]

                In early 2013, EA Sports announced that the next installment of the Madden series would be released on
                August 27, 2013. As this installment is the 25th anniversary of the series,[42] the game is called
                Madden
                NFL 25, instead of Madden NFL 14 with the year like the previous versions.[43] The cover vote consisted
                of
                two brackets containing past players ("Old School") and active players ("New School").[44]
            </p>

            <p>
                "Old School" player and Pro Football Hall of Famer Barry Sanders was chosen as the cover athlete for
                Madden
                NFL 25 on the April 24, 2013, episode of ESPN's SportsNation. The "New School" finalist was Adrian
                Peterson.[45]

                On March 13, 2014 EA Sports posted on its website that user would be able to design and submit uniforms
                for
                Connected Careers by March 17, 2014, for "the next Madden NFL."[46] On April 28, 2014, EA announced the
                release of Madden 15 pre-ordering in a release video with NFL linebacker and 2013 Defensive Player of
                the
                Year Luke Kuechly. The game was released August 26 in North America and on August 29 in the EU for Xbox
                One,
                PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The game featured "dramatic all-new camera angles, as
                well as
                dynamic pre-game and halftime features."[47] During the Detroit Lions 10th pick of the 2014 NFL draft,
                Barry
                Sanders announced fans again would be able to vote for the cover athlete.[48] On June 6, Seattle
                Seahawks
                cornerback Richard Sherman was announced as the cover athlete.[49]

                EA decided not to have players vote for the cover athlete through a traditional bracket, but rather
                through
                collectible cards in Madden NFL Mobile, or through Ultimate Team on the console devices. On May 4, 2015,
                the
                four finalists were announced for the 2016 game cover: New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski,
                Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson, New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and
                Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. On May 13, Beckham Jr. beat out Gronkowski in a fan
                vote
                for the cover of Madden 16. It was released on August 25, 2015.[50]

                the Frostbite Engine, and it incorporates a story mode titled Longshot Mode, akin to The Journey in FIFA
                17.[54] It was announced that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady would be on the cover, marking
                the
                second consecutive year where a Patriot will be on the cover.[55] Furthermore, an enhanced G.O.A.T.

            <h3 id="curse">Curse</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Prior to 1998, every annual installment of the Madden NFL series primarily featured Madden on its
                cover.[3][117] In 1998, Electronic Arts selected Garrison Hearst to appear on the PAL version's cover,
                although Madden remained on the North American release. Beginning with Eddie George in 2000, the series
                has usually featured one of the league's top players on every annual installment,[118] despite Madden's
                opposition.[3] While appearing on the cover has become an honor akin to appearing on the Wheaties
                box,[3] much like the Sports Illustrated Cover Jinx, certain players who appeared on Madden video game
                box art have experienced a decline in performance or an injury. This run of misfortune for Madden cover
                athletes has been dubbed the "Madden curse".[119]</p>

            <p>When asked about the Madden Curse, EA Sports' Chris Erb said, "I don't know that we believe in the curse.
                The players don't believe in the curse."[120] Running back Shaun Alexander, who was featured on the
                cover of Madden NFL 07, commented, "Do you want to be hurt and on the cover, or just hurt?" and Madden
                NFL 08 cover athlete Vince Young expressed skepticism,[121][122] while Madden NFL 12 cover athlete
                Peyton Hillis attributed his subpar season that year to the curse.[123]</p>

            <p>The perception that the curse is real has resulted in fans lobbying for their favorite players not to be
                on the cover, such as fans of LaDainian Tomlinson who were strongly opposed to EA Sports' initial
                decision to feature him on the cover of Madden NFL 08, so much that a fan created SaveLTfromMadden.com
                to voice their disdain.[124][125][126] Tomlinson declined the offer, but later said it was solely due to
                contract negotiations.[126] Starting with Madden NFL 11 EA has allowed fans to choose their favorite
                player for the cover.[127] However, EA believes that many fans vote against their favorite player to
                avoid the "curse".[8] It has become so prominent that bookmakers create odds on how likely an injury
                will occur to the player appearing on the cover.[128]</p>

            <p>The injuries that Madden cover athletes experience can be attributed to the physical nature of
                football.[120] Critics of the curse also note several players had successful seasons when they appeared
                on the cover, such as Madden NFL 13's Calvin Johnson, who set the single-season record for receiving
                yards, Madden NFL 18's Tom Brady, who was named MVP, and Madden NFL 20's Patrick Mahomes, who won Super
                Bowl LIV and was named Super Bowl MVP.[129][130]</p>

            <p>In December 2010, EA announced plans to develop a comedy film based on the Madden curse.[131] However, EA
                Entertainment executive Pat O'Brien stated in October 2014 that EA is not working on a Madden curse
                movie.[132]</p>
